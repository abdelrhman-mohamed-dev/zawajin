POST /auth/login
{
  "email": "ahmed.hassan@example.com",
  "password": "Test@123"
}

# Get recommendations
GET /matching/recommendations?page=1&limit=10&minCompatibilityScore=60
```

- Like/unlike other users
- View sent/received likes
- Test match creation
- Block/unblock users

### 3. Chat Testing
- View existing conversations (4 available)
- Send new messages to matched users
- Test WebSocket real-time messaging
- Mark messages as read

### 4. Profile Management
- Update user profiles
- View other user profiles

- Messages include **realistic Islamic content**
- Matching preferences reflect **diverse user requirements**

## Data Reset

To reset and re-seed:

```bash
# Option 1: Drop and recreate database
dropdb zawaj_in

TRUNCATE TABLE users CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE subscription_plans CASCADE;
```
